# The Flyers

## About:
Using the materials that I picked up from my Software Engineering bootcamp, I decided to create a MERN stack app that people with a background in aviation could interact.

The Flyers is a community where people who share a passion for aviation can meet and share their fun adventures or discuss changes in the world of aviation.
